# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** A user can dispatch a signature request via SMS and receive a signed document back — the full send-sign-confirm loop must work end to end.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Phase 3 — Database Foundation

## Current Position

Milestone: v2.0 User Management
Phase: 3 of 6 (Database Foundation)
Plan: 01 (complete)
Status: Phase 3 Plan 01 complete — ready for Plan 02 or Phase 4
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Phase 3 Plan 01 complete; Supabase connection verified live; test-supabase.php deleted from repo and pushed

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 33% (v1.0 complete; v2.0 not started)

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Summary:**
- Phases: 2 | Plans: 5 | LOC: 798
- Total execution time: ~8min
- Timeline: 1 day (2026-02-27 → 2026-02-28)

**v2.0 Summary:**
- Phases: 4 (phases 3-6) | Plans: TBD | LOC: TBD
- Total execution time: 0min so far

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Key v2.0 decisions (pre-build):
- Custom `public.users` table over Supabase GoTrue Auth — keeps auth in PHP sessions, no JWT complexity
- PHP cURL for all Supabase calls — same pattern as Micropay, service_role key stays server-side
- `password_hash()` / `password_verify()` — PHP owns the full password lifecycle, no third-party auth library
- Login replacement built LAST (Phase 6) — requires a real Supabase user to test; highest risk to existing v1.0 flow

Phase 3 Plan 01 decisions (confirmed in production):
- Dual-header auth required: both `apikey` and `Authorization: Bearer` headers must be sent for service_role to bypass RLS
- api/config.php permanently untracked via .gitignore — credentials never enter git history
- test-supabase.php deleted immediately after verification — security exposure via public URL

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MANUAL ACTION PENDING: Delete `api/test-supabase.php` from cPanel server at `public_html/FirstApp/api/` (removed from git repo in afaf3a0, but the deployed copy on the live server must be deleted manually)
- Verify cPanel PHP version before Phase 4 begins (must be 7.4+ for `password_hash` constant compatibility)
